# Reddit-RSS-Feed-App
A Reddit RSS Feed Reader Client for Android.

For those of you who are not familiar with www.Reddit.com, it is considered "The Front Page of the Internet". They have hundreds (if not thousands) of subreddits where users can browse content and explore. Often even celebrities will log onto Reddit.com and answer questions that fans might have.


A Reddit RSS App built by extracting information using Reddit RSS Feed, uses Retrofit Library as its base of REST operations and integrates with the website's open source API.

Here is a list of concepts we used in this app:


-RSS Feeds

-Parsing XML with Retrofit Library (extracting information from a website)

-Parsing JSON with Retrofit Libary (posting and extracting information from a website)

-POST requests with Retrofit Library

-GET requests with Retrofit Library

-Integrating an Android App with an existing webstie API (Reddit open source API)

-Logging into your Reddit Account using the App

-Viewing post and comments

-Recycler View

-Toolbars, Navigation Bars, Menus

-Passing data between activities with intents

-CardViews

-WebViews

-Basic Android Material Design


Note: The API used in this app is now deprecated so the login and comment system acts as a dummy, while everything still works. I might update this in the near future. Enjoy for now!
